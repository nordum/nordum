    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Answers to common questions about Nordum",
    "whatIsNordum": "What is Nordum?",
    "whatIsNordumAnswer": "Nordum is a constructed pan-Scandinavian written language designed to serve as a common written standard for Scandinavian communication in the modern world. It aims to maximize mutual intelligibility between Norwegian (Bokmål), Danish, and Swedish while maintaining systematic regularity and practical modern usage.",
    "whyCreated": "Why was Nordum created?",
    "whyCreatedAnswer": "Nordum was created in response to several modern realities:",
    "changingLandscape": "Changing linguistic landscape: English has increasingly become the main language of international communication, while Scandinavian languages are used to a smaller degree in global contexts",
    "geographicMobility": "Geographic mobility: People travel more frequently across Scandinavia, creating a need for easier cross-border communication",
    "digitalCommunication": "Digital communication: The internet and digital platforms require simple, consistent language standards",
    "replacementQuestion": "Is Nordum meant to replace existing Scandinavian languages?",
    "replacementAnswer1": "Absolutely not. Nordum is not designed to forbid or replace the current written languages (Norwegian, Danish, Swedish). Instead, it provides an additional option for those who wish to use a common Scandinavian standard to make communication easier across national borders.",
    "replacementAnswer2": "The goal is to allow for the usage of Nordum as a supplementary written language that enables Scandinavians to communicate without having to change language every few kilometers when traveling across the region.",
    "nynorskRelationship": "How does Nordum relate to Nynorsk?",
    "nynorskAnswer1": "Nordum takes a different approach than Nynorsk, which was created in the 19th century as part of the Norwegian nationalist movement. Nynorsk was specifically designed to separate from Danish and Swedish influences as much as possible, drawing heavily from rural Norwegian dialects.",
    "nynorskAnswer2": "In contrast, Nordum embraces the common Scandinavian heritage and aims to bridge the languages rather than separate them. Where Nynorsk sought distinction, Nordum seeks connection and mutual intelligibility.",
    "historicalContext": "What is the historical context of Scandinavian languages?",
    "historicalAnswer1": "Historically, the Scandinavian languages formed a dialect continuum where neighboring dialects were mutually intelligible. The modern standardized languages emerged through separate standardization processes:",
    "danishStandardization": "Danish: Standardized through administration and Luther's Bible translation",
    "swedishStandardization": "Swedish: Developed through state administration and literature",
    "norwegianStandardization": "Norwegian: Evolved through both Danish influence (Bokmål) and nationalist movements (Nynorsk)",
    "historicalAnswer2": "Nordum recognizes this shared heritage and creates a modern written standard that honors all three traditions while providing practical utility for contemporary communication needs.",
    "targetAudience": "Who can use Nordum?",
    "targetAudienceList": "Nordum is designed for:",
    "scandinavians": "Scandinavians communicating across borders",

    "travelers": "Travelers and expatriates living in Scandinavia",
    "anyoneInterested": "Anyone interested in pan-Scandinavian communication",
    "learningDifficulty": "Is Nordum easy to learn for Scandinavian speakers?",
    "learningAnswer": "Yes! Nordum is designed to be immediately accessible to speakers of any Scandinavian language. The lexical selection prioritizes words that are already familiar across all three languages, and the grammatical system simplifies many of the irregularities found in the individual languages.",
    "englishLoanwords": "How does Nordum handle English loanwords?",
    "englishAnswer": "Nordum preserves English loanwords for technical and modern terms where they are already widely used across Scandinavia. This reflects the reality of modern Scandinavian communication where English terms are commonly integrated, particularly in technology, business, and academic contexts.",
    "contribution": "How can I contribute to Nordum?",
